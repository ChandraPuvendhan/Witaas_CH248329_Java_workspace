1995 1st version
James Gosling
one remote control
different gadgets
washing machine
domestic appliances
chip which programmed implant not same
on dish washer - start functioning
on tv
c++ platform architecture dependant
make changes to program native language
oak
oak not machine specific but s/w h/w middle ware implanted in machine - convert to machine specific - translator
JVM came up
project failed
byproduct 94 95 interact era - html pages low bandwidth limited script
applet - small application embedded - gaming - dynamic
netscape navigator, microsoft rejected - can harm - download from internet - virus
sandbox - isolate from running os
JVM - machine specific
indonesia island
coffee
platform independent 32 64 architecture
os to operate on h/w
core part of os - kernel talks to h/w
s/w on os - actually talking to underlying architecture
no common JVM - different JVMs
install JVM in the form JRE

class loader
Bootstrap - system class
extension
application
class loader - upload class - create own

verify - check virus - violate - security exception
prepare
resolve dependencies

override dev code with malicious code - virus

program (static) converted to process (in memory represnetation of that program)

main inbuilt thread

code is in method area
no global variable in JAVA

heap - objects are created

thread - CPU executing

OS time slicing for each process to execute
PC register - bookmark - remember page number
native - c++
interpreter - line by line
compile exe directly
here interpreter
JIT compiler - run in algorithm - repeated cpu cycle wastage
garbage collector - low priority thread - object not being used
cant increase heap at runtime
assigning null so new objects use released memory
similar process mapping as c
thread code under execution
java natively
multithread
process - 1 thread reading, 1 writing parallel jobs


5 steps
src --> complie --> class loader --> bytecode verify --> interpret --> execute

write dev JDK

just execute JRE
oracle acquired sun microsystem
14 latest version

bin binary
small applications
jar
jrt jar files
jvm for windows

no path --> goto location where
cmd prompt locate where so path setup environment - where location

java --version
java -version
cls
notepad

class 1st letter caps
public then same class name
no public any name
ren -- rename
no 2 public class
n number of class -- n number of .class files

javac compile file name

java execute class name

binary answer

Unix
Propraitary
licensed
Linux freeware kernel different type of shell, bash shell - general purpose
fedora red hat centos ubuntu
writing on server - stable than windows
admin Linux
dev Windows
rpm
Linux redhat rpm package manager - zip - msi files
su - switch user


eclipse - jdbc - external jar file - build path

CLASSPATH
3rd party
location of jar files
javac -cp
. dot current path


overloading many main method
static non static main same
no order arg different


executable main method JRE lookup for main

public accessible outside class in any package anywhere
static class level not object level
void not return - no use of returning -
c int main no exception

command line argument - runtime
string - any number character any

System class
final cant inherit
out variable of
java.lang package

System
in read
out write
error

parsing converting wrapper class
